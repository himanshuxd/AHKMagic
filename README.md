## What AHK Scripts Help:

- **Lesser Keystrokes:** With AHK repetitive frequently used long texts or commands can be stored somewhere ready to be inserted, foregoing the "copying" part altogether.
- **Quicker Actions:** When dealing with common tasks like opening command windows, AHK could be handy with a shortcut.

## List of AutoHotkey Scripts:

1. ### Command Prompt with a Fn Key
